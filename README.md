## Usage Instructions ## 
- Before running setup.sh edit sh_header.tmp to the base configs you wish to inject into every .sh script you create with VIM.
- Once ready run # sudo chmod +x setup.sh
- Then run # ./setup.sh

The script will move the template into the correct location, and update ~/.vimrc

## BEST OF LUCK! ##
